## Assignment 7

For this assignment start from the existing intellitect/Assignment7 branch.

- Create controllers and views to do the following
  - Users
     - Display all users
     - Add a user
     - Edit a user
     - Remove a user
  - Groups
     - Display all grpups
     - Add a user
     - Edit a user
     - Remove a user
- Create a page for managing a users gifts
   - This will be done using VueJs and will be using typescript for sending data to and from the API
     - Show all gifts
     - Add a gift
     - Edit a gift
     - Remove a gift
- The web application should use the generated classes that are created from nswagstudio (or other tool)
- If I enter invalid data (empty first name for a user) it should not save off the data and should tell me about the error
- No unit tests are expected for this since most of the logic is actually already tested in the API

### Going above and beyond
- Create screens that allow you to manage which users are associated with different groups. Remember, since it is a many to many, users can belong to more than one group. This can be done either using the server side calls or the javascript calls, dealers choice.
